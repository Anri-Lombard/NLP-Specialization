# Auto-correct and Minimum Edit Distance

1. The minimum edit distance between the words deep and creepy is:
   - 4
2. Which of the following is a NOT VALID example of an edit string operation?
   - SWITCH a letter ‘Lusca’ --> ‘Lucas’
3. Autocorrect is only appliable when dealing with misspelled words.
   - False
4. Given the corpus:

    “I am happy because I am doing quizzes.”

    Based on this tiny corpus, consider the following sentence:

    “I sm very good at solving quizzes.”

    Which of the following is true?
    - There is a unique correction for the misspelled word “sm”.
5. About the probabilistic model defined in the lecture, select all that apply.
   - If $C(w)$ is the number of times a word appears in a corpus and $V$ is the corpus size, then the probability of the word $w$ in the corpus is $P(w) = \frac{C(w)}{V}$.
   - Replacing a character costs more than deleting a character.
   - The sentence “Happy birthday deer friends” would not have any word corrected in the model defined in the lecture.
6. Suppose we build a distance matrix D for the following case:

    Source: Pie --> Target: Bye

    What is the value for D[3,2]?
    - ?
7. About the Minimum edit distance algorithm, select all that apply. Let D be the distance matrix, for two words of same size. The matrix size is n.
8. About the minimum edit distance, which of the following statement is not true?
   - $D[0,i] > D[0,j]$ if $i > j$
   - It is used to check if a word is misspelled.
9. The minimum edit distance calculation is more computationally intensive if we have a big corpus.
    - False
10. Given the corpus “Autocorrect is a powerful tool and it is used on our computer.”

    The value for P(is) is:

    The answer should have two decimal places (rounding up, if necessary).
    - 0.17

## Min edit distance algorithm

```python
def minimum_edit_distance(source, target):
    # Initialize the distance matrix
    m, n = len(source), len(target)
    D = [[0 for _ in range(n + 1)] for _ in range(m + 1)]
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        D[i][0] = i
    for j in range(1, n + 1):
        D[0][j] = j

    # Fill in the rest of the matrix
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            cost = 0 if source[i - 1] == target[j - 1] else 1
            D[i][j] = min(D[i - 1][j] + 1, D[i][j - 1] + 1, D[i - 1][j - 1] + cost)

    # Return the minimum edit distance matrix
    return D
```
