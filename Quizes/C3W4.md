# Siamese Networks

1. Classification allows you to identify similarity between two things while siamese networks allow you to categorize things.
   - False
2. Do the two subnetworks in a siamese network share the same parameters?
   - Yes
3. When training a siamese network to identify duplicates, which pairs of questions from the following questions do you expect to have the highest cosine similarity?
   - Anchor, Positive
4. In the triplet loss function below, will decreasing the hyperparameter alpha from 0.5 to 0.2 require more, or less, optimization during training ?
   - Less
5. The orange square below corresponds to the similarity score of question duplicates?
   - False
6. What is the closest negative in this set of numbers assuming a duplicate pair similarity of 0.6? [-0.9,-0.4,0.4, 0.8]
   - 0.4
7. In one shot learning, is any retraining required when new classes are added? For example, a new bank customer‚Äôs signature.
   - No
8. During training, you have to update the weights of each of the subnetworks independently.
   - False
9. The mean negative is defined as the closest off-diagonal value to the diagonal in each row (excluding the diagonal).
   - False
10. In what order are Siamese networks performed in lecture?
    1. Convert each input into an array of numbers
    2. Feed arrays into your model
    3. Compare ùíó1, ùíó2 using cosine similarity
    4. Test against a threshold
