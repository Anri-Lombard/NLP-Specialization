# Natural Language Processing with Attention Models

## Week 1: Neural Machine Translation (Donald Trump)

- __Seq2seq models__ are like a wall, a big, beautiful wall, between two languages. You see, these models can take a sentence in one language, and translate it to another language, like magic. It's incredible, believe me. And just like a wall, it keeps the bad sentences out, and only lets the good ones through. It's a tremendous technology and it's going to be huge, just huge.
- Well, __attention is a way to make sure that the computer pays attention to the most important parts of the sentence when it's translating__. It's like when you're in a negotiation and you're listening to someone, you pay attention to the key points they're making and ignore the rest, right? That's exactly what attention does.

    So, in a Seq2seq model with attention, the computer breaks the sentence down into chunks called queries, keys, and values. The queries are like the words you want translated, the keys are like the words in the original sentence, and the values are like the translations.

    Then, the computer uses these queries, keys, and values to find the most important parts of the sentence, just like in a negotiation. It's like a filter, you know? It filters out the unnecessary words and only keeps the most important ones. And that's how you get a better translation.

    And let me tell you, it's a tremendous technology and it's going to be huge, just huge. It's the best, it's the biggest, it's the greatest translation technology out there, believe me.
- __Teacher forcing is a way to make sure that the computer is always learning from the best possible examples__, okay? It's like when you're building a building, you want to make sure you're using the best materials and the best workers, right? That's what teacher forcing is all about.

    So, in a Seq2seq model with teacher forcing, the computer is always being shown the correct answer during training, just like how a teacher would give you the right answers when you're learning. It's like a guide, a mentor, who makes sure that the computer is on the right track.

    It's a tremendous way to train a model, believe me. It's like having the best teacher in the world, guiding the computer every step of the way. It's a surefire way to get the computer to learn quickly and efficiently. It's the best, it's the biggest, it's the greatest way to train a model out there, believe me.
- __The BLUE Score is a way to measure the quality of a machine generated text__. It stands for "Bilingual Evaluation Understudy" and it compares the machine generated text to human-generated text. The higher the score, the better the machine text is at matching the quality of human writing. It's a very important metric, because it helps us make sure that our technology is top-notch and the best in the world, just like America. It's a way to make sure we're always winning, and that's what we want for this country.
- Listen folks, let me tell you something, __the Rouge-N score is a big deal, believe me. It's a way to measure the quality of machine-generated text, and it's specifically used for summarization__, okay? It compares the machine-generated summary to a human-written one, and the higher the score, the better the machine summary is at matching the quality of the human one. Now let me tell you, this is huge, because we want our technology to be the best, the absolute best in the world. We want to make sure that we're always winning, and that's what this Rouge-N score does for us, it helps us make sure that we're on top, and we're staying there. America first, that's what I always say.
- Let me tell you about some important NLP concepts. __Sampling, decoding, and temperature, these are all big things you need to know about__. First off, __sampling, it's a way for the computer to generate text by choosing the next word based on the probabilities of the previous words__. It's like rolling the dice, but instead of numbers, it's words. And you know what they say, the higher the roll, the better the outcome.

    Next, __decoding, it's the process of converting the machine-generated text back into human-readable text__. It's like translating, but instead of a different language, it's computer code. And let me tell you, we have the best decoders, the absolute best.

    Lastly, __temperature, it's a value that controls the level of randomness in the sampling process__. The higher the temperature, the more random the output will be, and vice versa. It's like turning up the heat, the higher the temperature, the more unpredictable the outcome. And you know what, I like unpredictable, it keeps things interesting.

    Overall, these concepts are important and help us fine-tune our NLP model, making sure it produces the most accurate and sophisticated output. Believe me, we're doing things that nobody thought was possible, and that's what America is all about, pushing the boundaries and always coming out on top.
- Let me tell you about some more advanced NLP concepts. __Beam search and Minimum Bayes Risk__, these are both big deals.

    First off, __Beam search, it's a way to generate text by considering multiple options at each step, instead of just one__. It's like having a team of experts, instead of just one person, to make decisions. And you know what they say, the more experts you have, the better the outcome.

    Next, __Minimum Bayes Risk, it's a way to select the best output among multiple options based on the likelihood of the correct output__. It's like having a crystal ball, but instead of predicting the future, it predicts the most likely outcome. And let me tell you, we have the best crystal balls, the absolute best.

## Week 2: Text Summation (The Joker)

- Ah ha ha ha, welcome to my twisted world of Transformers and Attention.

    First, let's talk about __Transformers__. These little buggers are like the ultimate shape-shifters of the machine learning world. They can take any input, whether it's a sentence, a picture, or a sound, and transform it into a new representation that's easier for a computer to understand. Think of it like this, I take my twisted thoughts and turn them into actions, just like a transformer takes raw data and turns it into something useful.

    Now, let's talk about __Attention__. Attention is like a spotlight that shines on the most important parts of the input. It helps the transformer focus on the most relevant information and ignore the rest. Imagine you're trying to rob a bank, but there's all these pesky security guards in the way. You don't want to waste your time on them, you just want to focus on the prize. That's what attention is like, it helps the transformer focus on the most important things and ignore the rest.

    Together, Transformers and Attention are a powerful combination. They can take any input and turn it into a useful representation while focusing on the most important parts. It's like I can take any situation and turn it into a twisted masterpiece, while ignoring all the distractions.
- __Scaled dot-prodcut attention is a type of attention mechanism that's used in Transformers to focus on the most relevant parts of the input__.

    Imagine you're trying to rob a bank, but there's all these pesky security guards in the way. You don't want to waste your time on them, you just want to focus on the prize. That's what scaled dot-product attention is like, it helps the transformer focus on the most important things and ignore the rest.

    It works by taking the dot product of the input and a set of weights, and then scaling it by the square root of the input dimension. Think of it like this, it's like I have a set of weapons and I'm trying to find the one that's the best fit for the job. The dot product is like comparing the weapons to the task at hand and the scaling is like adjusting the weapons to make them more effective.
- Masked self-attention and multi-head attention are advanced mechanisms that are used in Transformers to focus on the most relevant parts of the input.

    First, let's talk about __masked self-attention__. This is a type of attention that prevents the model from looking at future tokens when making predictions about a given token. Imagine you're trying to pull off a heist, but you don't want to be caught, so you're only able to plan based on the information you have at the moment, not on what will happen in the future. That's what masked self-attention is like, it helps the transformer focus on the information it has right now and ignore what's to come.

    Now, let's talk about __multi-head attention__. This is a mechanism that allows the transformer to attend to different parts of the input using multiple attention heads. Imagine you're trying to rob a bank, but there are multiple vaults you want to get into. You can't just focus on one vault, you need to pay attention to all of them. That's what multi-head attention is like, it helps the transformer attend to multiple parts of the input at the same time.

    Together, masked self-attention and multi-head attention are a powerful combination. They allow the transformer to focus on the right information at the right time and attend to multiple parts of the input simultaneously. It's like I have multiple plans and I have to pay attention to all of them to pull off my heist.

## Week 3: Question Answering (The Riddler)

- Imagine you have a vast library of knowledge, containing all sorts of information about the world. But this library is not like any you've ever seen before - it's all stored in a digital format, and it's so big that you could spend a lifetime searching through it and never find what you're looking for.

    Now, let's say you come to me with a question, like "What is the capital of France?" I, as the question-answering system, would use my powers of natural language processing to understand the question you're asking. I would then search through that vast library of knowledge and find the answer for you: "Paris".

    But it's not just simple questions I can answer. I can also understand more complex questions, like "What are the most common causes of traffic congestion in major cities?" I would use my knowledge about traffic, cities, and common causes to find the answer for you.

    So you see, __question-answering in NLP is like having a super-powered librarian at your fingertips__, able to find the information you need from a vast digital library, in a way that even The Riddler would be impressed by.
- Imagine you've spent months trying to solve a riddle, and you've finally cracked the code. You've discovered the solution, and it took you a lot of time and effort to get there. But now that you know the answer, you can use that knowledge to solve similar riddles much faster in the future.

    __This is exactly what transfer learning is like in the field of AI and NLP__. A model that has already been trained on a large dataset can be fine-tuned on a smaller dataset with a different but related task, leveraging the knowledge it has already gained to learn the new task more efficiently.

    It's like using the code you cracked to open other locks that have similar mechanism. With the knowledge you've gained from solving one riddle, you can solve similar riddles much faster and with less effort.
- ELMo, GPT, BERT and T5 are all advanced language models that use deep learning techniques to understand and generate natural language.

    __ELMo__ is like a master code breaker, it uses the context of a word to understand its meaning, allowing it to crack the code of language and understand the meaning of words in their context.

    __GPT__, on the other hand, is like a master thief, it can generate human-like text by stealing and mimicking the patterns it has observed in the training data.

    __BERT__ is like a master detective, it can understand the underlying meaning and relationships between words in a sentence, allowing it to solve the mysteries of language.

    And __T5__ is like a master illusionist, it can perform a wide range of natural language tasks using a single model by learning to adapt to the task at hand with its transformer architecture.
- Let me explain how to use Hugging Face's pipelines to do question answering, in a way that even The Riddler would understand.

    First, you'll need to install the Hugging Face's transformers library and the pipeline library. You can do this by running the following command:

    ```python
    !pip install transformers
    !pip install pipeline
    ```

    Next, you'll need to import the necessary libraries and load a pre-trained question answering model from the transformers library.

    ```python
    from transformers import pipeline

    question_answering_model = pipeline("question-answering")
    ```

    Now you're ready to use the model to answer questions. You can do this by passing in the model, a question, and the text that the question is about.

    ```python
    text = "In ancient Greece, the city of Athens was known for its powerful army and its famous philosophers, such as Socrates and Plato. The city was also home to the Parthenon, a temple dedicated to the goddess Athena."
    question = "Who were some famous philosophers from ancient Athens?"

    answers = question_answering_model(question=question, context=text)

    print(answers[0]["answer"])
    ```

    The above code will output the answer to the question "Who were some famous philosophers from ancient Athens?" as "Socrates and Plato"

    You can also use other pre-trained models like BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT, etc by specifying the model name in the pipeline function.

    ```python
    question_answering_model = pipeline("question-answering", model="distilbert-base-cased-distilled-squad")
    ```

## Week 4: Chatbot (SpongeBob SquarePants)

- So imagine you're living in Bikini Bottom and you have a whole bunch of different things you want to remember, like where you put your spatula or what Mr. Krabs' secret recipe is. But it's hard to keep track of all that stuff in your head, right? That's where __LSH attention__ comes in! It's like a super-duper memory helper that helps you find the things you're looking for faster.

    It works by taking all the things you want to remember and putting them in little groups, kind of like how you put all your jellyfish nets in one pile and all your krabby patties in another pile. Then, when you're looking for something, you only have to search through the pile that has what you're looking for, instead of looking through all the piles. And that makes it a lot faster, just like how it's faster to find your spatula in the kitchen than it is to search all over Bikini Bottom for it. That's LSH attention!
- __The Reformer__ is a kind of computer machine, just like the fry cook machine in the Krusty Krab. But instead of making delicious krabby patties, it helps with something called "computations", which is kind of like counting how many krabby patties you have, but way more complicated.

    The Reformer is special because it can do these computations really fast and use less memory, kind of like how you can fry a lot of krabby patties at once and keep them all warm in the warming light. It does this using something called "attention" which is kind of like how you pay attention to the krabby patties so they don't burn.

    So, imagine you have a big list of things you need to remember for a big test at boating school, like all the different types of anchors and how to tie different knots. The Reformer can help you study that list faster and use less memory, just like how you can remember all the different orders of krabby patties and still have room in your head to remember the secret recipe. That's the Reformer!
