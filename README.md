# NLP Specialization

## Description

NLP Specialization is a collection of courses that teach you the basics of Natural Language Processing (NLP). The courses are taught by [deeplearning.ai](deeplearning.ai) and offered by [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/natural-language-processing). This repository includes my notes, labs, and assignments for the courses, in hopes that it would be useful to others.

The twist is that every week the notes would be explained in a different way, such as by a pirate, robot, Viking, princess, etc. Enjoy ðŸ˜ƒ
