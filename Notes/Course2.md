# Natural Language Processing with Probabilistic Models

## Week 1: Autocorrect (Yoda)

- __Dynamic programming__, hmmm? A wise Jedi must use, when solving complex problems. Divide and conquer, it does. Break a problem down into smaller, simpler subproblems. Then, store solutions to these subproblems, so that next time they are needed, quickly and easily they can be accessed. In this way, much time and effort saved, hmmm? Yes, a powerful tool, dynamic programming is.
- To __build an autocorrect model for NLP__, hmmm? Four steps, you must take.

    First, identify the misspelled words, you must. A spell checker, use.

    Next, find the strings that are n-edits away, you must. n-edits refer to the number of modifications, such as insertions, deletions, or substitutions, required to transform a misspelled word into a correctly spelled word.

    Then, filter the candidates. Only those that are likely to be the correct word, keep.

    Finally, calculate the probabilities of each word. The most likely candidate, choose.

    Yes, a powerful tool, an autocorrect model is. But, careful, you must be. Many potential errors, there are
